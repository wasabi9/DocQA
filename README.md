## Requirements 
1. Install tesseract using brew -- brew install tesseract
2. Have tested on python 3.9 and 3.10, might break for other versions
3. OpenAI API keys with enought monies in it. Though 3.5 is honestly very cheap for personal small scale usage.
3. Install python libraries using requirements.txt

## Road ahead:
1. Chat session for docs
2. Multiple document inputs
3. Across sessions query
